It's able to automatically switch between various lighting conditions with ease—making your photos look great whether it's bright or dark, day or night. If it's dark, the lens opens to F1.5 mode to pull in light for a bright and clear photo and in the daylight, the lens shifts to F2.4 mode to help your picture come out sharp. Super Slow-mo lets you see the things you could have missed in the blink of an eye. Set the video to music or turn it into a looping GIF, and share it with a tap. Then sit back and watch the reactions roll in. Create an Augmented Reality version of yourself simply by taking a selfie. Then share your real-life feelings as emoji stickers and videos. Intelligent Scan is a new technology that combines face recognition and iris scan to make unlocking simple even in low light."
